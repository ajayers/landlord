# This file should contain all the creation needed to seed a tenant schema with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake landlord:seed
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
